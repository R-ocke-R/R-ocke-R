<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Manu Sharma</h1>

- I'm a highly inquisitive person, currently looking forward to doing HCI research as a graduate student
- I believe there's only one way to find out your true interests; by giving it a shot and seeing if it sticks. In the last 3 years I've worked as a data enginneer, analyst-consultant and even tried my hands on being a user interface desginer.
- Here is a list of projects you can find tagged by domain.
  - Talking_Turtle: Human Computer/Robot Interaction
  - Reciprocal Attention: Human Computer/Robot Interaction
  - ThinkGraph - Human Computer Interaction, LLM Interface study
  - Streamlit-Deployement - Web Portfolio with a small list of mini-projects using data visualization and python
  - FishDetection - Machine Learning Project, does exactly what the name suggests
  - Design Portfolio - https://sh-manu.framer.website/
